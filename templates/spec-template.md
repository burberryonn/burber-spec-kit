# Specification For: [FEATURE NAME]

**Slug**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Date**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Generated By**: `$ARGUMENTS`

> Default stack: Vite + React + TypeScript (strict) + Mantine + Zustand + i18next. Tailwind is intentionally excluded unless justified.

## Functional Scope (MVP to nice-to-have)

Describe the customer problem, business motivation, and success criteria. Split requirements by priority:
- **Phase 1 – [Goal] (P1)**: [Key flows and outcomes for the initial release]
- **Phase 2 – [Goal] (P2)**: [Enhancements unlocked after P1]
- **Phase 3 – [Goal] (P3)**: [Longer-term improvements or optimisations]

Each phase should list:
- **Capability** – What the user can do.
- **Acceptance Signals** – How we know the capability works.
- **Delivery Notes** – Implementation hints, references to shared utilities, blockers.

## Architecture & FSD Alignment

- **app**: Providers, routing, Mantine theme mounting, ErrorBoundary.
- **shared**: UI primitives, helpers, API clients, configuration, types.
- **entities**: Domain primitives with minimal UI.
- **features**: User-facing slices combining domain + UI logic.
- **widgets**: Compositions of features/entities.
- **pages**: Routed surfaces.
- **processes** (optional): Cross-cutting flows.

Highlight deviations, reuse expectations, or new directories.

## Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: [Requirement description]
- **FR-002**: [Requirement description]
- **FR-003**: [Requirement description]
- Flag anything that still needs clarification as `NEEDS CLARIFICATION`.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Accessibility: WCAG, ARIA, keyboard operability.
- Performance: Identify critical metrics and budgets.
- Reliability: Error handling, empty states, fallbacks.
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions run `lint`, `typecheck`, `build`, `test`.
- Documentation: Architecture docs, ADR, changelog entries.

---

## Technical Constraints & Decisions

- TypeScript `"strict": true`, `"noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true`.
- ESLint with `typescript-eslint`, `import`, `react`, Prettier formatting.
- Mantine theme tokens instead of Tailwind or arbitrary CSS frameworks.
- Routing via React Router v6.30+ with suspense-ready data flows.
- State managed via Zustand; call out if Redux Toolkit is required.
- Provide reasons for exceptions to the defaults.

## Data Contracts

- **[Entity]**: [Shape, source, ownership, privacy considerations]
- **[Entity]**: [...]

Include schemas, example payloads, and validation expectations.

---

## Success Criteria & Metrics

- **SC-001**: [Metric – target, measurement, owner]
- **SC-002**: [Metric – target, measurement, owner]
- **SC-003**: [Metric – target, measurement, owner]

## Review Prompts

- Are we solving the right problem for the customer?
- Does the FSD layout stay consistent with the shared architecture?
- Do we understand the DoD for each phase?
- Are documents, ADRs, and test plans aligned?
- Are there outstanding `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` items requiring follow-up?
