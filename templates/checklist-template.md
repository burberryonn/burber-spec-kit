## Usage Notes

- Track status with `[x]` when the requirement is satisfied.
- Keep links to supporting evidence close to each item (PRs, screenshots, test runs).
- Tag scenarios that need sign-off from QA, UX, Security, or Release.
- Feed `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` back into the specification or plan if new questions appear.
- The Markdown format remains plain so any agent (Claude, Codex, Roo Code, etc.) can mirror or validate the checklist.
