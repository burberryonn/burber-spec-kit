description: Identify open questions or missing details in the specification and plan.

## Prompt

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Purpose

Before implementation, surface ambiguities so they can be resolved in `spec.md`, `plan.md`, or supporting research. This command is safe to use with any agent (Claude, Codex, Roo Code, etc.) because it relies on plain Markdown output.

---

## Workflow

1. **Gather inputs**  
   - `{SCRIPT}` loads `FEATURE_DIR`, `spec.md`, and (if present) `plan.md`, `research.md`.  
   - Stop if the spec is missingâ€”run `/speckit.specify` first.

2. **Scan critical sections**  
   - Requirements marked `NEEDS CLARIFICATION`.  
   - Acceptance criteria lacking measurable outcomes.  
   - Missing Mantine component details, routing, state management decisions.  
   - Incomplete DoD items (tests, docs, CI, accessibility).

3. **Record questions**  
   - Use a table or bullet list with IDs (`Q1`, `Q2`, ...).  
   - Include owner, proposed resolution path, and links to context.  
   - Suggest alternatives when possible to speed up decisions.

4. **Echo back recommended updates**  
   - Which files need edits (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, ADR, roadmap).  
   - Which agent workflows should re-run after clarification (e.g. `/speckit.plan`, context scripts).  
   - Note any risk if left unresolved.
